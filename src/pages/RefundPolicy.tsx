VoltWorx is a platform that allows startups and creators to post real-world micro-tasks, which students can respond to with submissions. This Refund Policy outlines how refund requests for task listing fees are handled.

1. Fee Structure & Reward Distribution
Startups/creators pay a combined posting and reward fee when publishing a task.

VoltWorx charges a platform service fee (typically 10%), and the remaining reward is reserved for the selected student.

Reward payments to students are handled manually by VoltWorx outside the platform.

VoltWorx does not act as an escrow agent or financial intermediary.

2. Refund Eligibility
A full refund of the posting fee and reward may be issued if no student is selected and:

No valid submissions were received before the task deadline

All submissions were deemed irrelevant or unusable by VoltWorx

A verified technical error prevented the task from being visible or accessible

Refund requests must be submitted within 7 calendar days of the task deadline.

3. How to Request a Refund
To request a refund, the task creator must email team.voltworx@gmail.com with:

Task ID or title

Reason for refund

Supporting information (e.g., screenshot, submission history)

Requests are reviewed within 3â€“5 business days, and a decision will be communicated via email.

4. Cases Where Refunds Are Not Provided
Refunds will not be issued in the following scenarios:

A student was selected and the reward disbursement process has been initiated

The task description was unclear, misleading, or violated platform policies

The refund request was made after the 7-day eligibility window

5. Dispute Resolution
In case of disagreements or unclear situations, VoltWorx may:

Review task details, submission logs, and internal moderation notes

Contact involved parties for clarification

Issue a partial or full refund at its sole discretion

All decisions made by VoltWorx are considered final.
